Here is a SQL query that filters the ratings of movies where the rating is PG or G:

SELECT 
    rating,
    COUNT(film_id) AS count_of_movies,
    AVG(rental_rate) AS average_movie_rental_rate,
    MAX(rental_duration) AS maximum_rental_duration,
    MIN(rental_duration) AS minimum_rental_duration
FROM 
    film
WHERE 
    rating = 'PG' 
    OR rating = 'G'
GROUP BY 
    rating;
