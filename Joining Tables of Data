Here is a SQL Query with Inner Join involving multiple tables of data:

SELECT 
    B.customer_ID,
    B.first_name,
    B.last_name,
    D.city,
    E.country,
    SUM(amount) AS Total_Amount_Paid
FROM 
    payment A
INNER JOIN 
    customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN 
    address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN 
    city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN 
    country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID
WHERE 
    D.city IN (
        SELECT 
            C.city
        FROM 
            customer A
        INNER JOIN 
            address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
        INNER JOIN 
            city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
        INNER JOIN 
            country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
        WHERE 
            D.COUNTRY IN (
